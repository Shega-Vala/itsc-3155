<p>Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.</p>
<p>Successful engineers know how to use the right programming languages, platforms, and architectures to develop everything from computer games to network
control systems. In addition to building their own systems, software engineers also test, improve, and maintain software built by other engineers.</p>
