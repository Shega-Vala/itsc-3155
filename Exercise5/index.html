    <p id = "txt1">The belief that complex systems require armies of designers and programmers is wrong. A system that is not understood in its entirety, or at least to a significant degree of detail by a single individual, should probably not be built.
    <br> --Niklaus Wirth</p>
    <p id = "txt2">Good code is its own best documentation. As you are about to add a comment, ask yourself, How can I improve the code so that this comment is not needed? Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.
    <br>--Steve McConnell</p>
    <p id = "txt3">It's better to wait for a productive programmer to become available than it is to wait for the first available programmer to become productive.
    <br>--Steve McConnell </p>
    <p id = "txt4">There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.
